# Commented lines are supported (via a preceding # only).
# Packages from the AUR can be specified.
# If you require a package with a regex special character in the name
# (i.e.: .\?+[]{} etc.)
# and it is part of the ACTUAL package name, then you must DOUBLE-ESCAPE it:
# e.g. 'bonnie\\+\\+' for a package named 'bonnie++'
