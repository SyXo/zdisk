== Getting Started

=== Downloading
If it isn't in your distro's repositories (It *is* in Arch's AUR! Both https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bdisk/[tagged release] and https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bdisk-git/[git master].), you can still easily get rolling. Simply visit the project's https://git.square-r00t.net/BDisk/[source code web interface] and download a tarball under the *Download* column:

If you know the tag of the commit you want, you can use curl:

`curl -sL -o bdisk.tar.xz https://git.square-r00t.net/BDisk/snapshot/BDisk-3.11.tar.xz`

or wget:

`wget -O bdisk.tar.xz https://git.square-r00t.net/BDisk/snapshot/BDisk-3.11.tar.xz`

You can use `https://git.square-r00t.net/BDisk/snapshot/BDisk-master.tar.xz` for the URL if you want the latest working version. If you want a snapshot of a specific commit, you can use e.g. `https://git.square-r00t.net/BDisk/snapshot/BDisk-5ac510762ce00eef213957825de0e6d07186e7f8.tar.xz` and so on.

Alternatively, you can use https://git-scm.com/[git]. Git most definitely _should_ be in your distro's repositories.

TIP: If you're new to git and want to learn more, I highly recommend the book https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[Pro Git]. It is available for free download (or online reading).

You can use https:

You can clone via https:

`git clone https://git.square-r00t.net/BDisk`

or native git protocol:

`git clone git://git.square-r00t.net/bdisk.git BDisk`

The git protocol is much faster, but at a cost of lessened security.
