== Advanced Customization
If the <<the_code_build_ini_code_file,`build.ini`>> file doesn't provide enough customization to your liking, I don't blame you! It was designed only to provide the most basic control and is primarily only used to control the build process itself.

Luckily, there are a lot of changes you can make. For all of these, you'll want to make a copy of the <<code_basedir_code,`basedir`>> directory somewhere and change the basedir configuration option in the <<the_code_build_ini_code_file,`build.ini`>> file to point to the parent directory.
